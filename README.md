## üìñ About The Project

[cite_start]**Contextual Information Retrieval Assistant (CIRA)** is an AI-powered chatbot designed to be tailored to specific websites[cite: 103]. [cite_start]Traditional chatbots often fall short in resolving user queries, typically redirecting to a human agent or only answering FAQs[cite: 101, 102]. [cite_start]CIRA overcomes these limitations by integrating website content scraping and natural language processing powered by open-source Large Language Models (LLMs)[cite: 104]. [cite_start]This allows for the rapid and cost-effective deployment of intelligent chatbots that provide relevant and informative support[cite: 105].

[cite_start]Our platform is adaptable to various domains, including educational institutions, healthcare providers, and hosting platforms, enhancing the overall user experience[cite: 106]. [cite_start]CIRA enables users to extract answers directly from websites, eliminating time-consuming searches[cite: 107]. [cite_start]For instance, a survey showed that finding specific university fee information could take over 20 minutes for some students, while CIRA provided the same information in seconds[cite: 108]. [cite_start]CIRA leverages domain-specific data and powerful AI to deliver accurate, tailored information while prioritizing user security and privacy[cite: 109, 203].

## ‚ú® Key Features

* [cite_start]**Website Content Scraping:** Automatically scrapes and extracts relevant text, images, and links from a provided website to build its knowledge base[cite: 233, 234].
* [cite_start]**Advanced NLP:** Utilizes open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) like Meta's LLaMA2 to understand user queries and generate contextually relevant responses[cite: 198, 205, 236].
* [cite_start]**High Customization:** Offers a user-friendly dashboard for website owners to customize the chatbot's appearance, including colors, fonts, logos, and initial messages[cite: 240, 278, 316].
* [cite_start]**Easy Integration:** Website owners can add the chatbot to their site by simply pasting a single line of JavaScript code[cite: 255, 312].
* [cite_start]**User Statistics:** Provides a dashboard to view chatbot statistics, such as the total number of views and user engagement by country[cite: 319, 325].
* [cite_start]**Human-in-the-Loop:** Includes an optional feature to have a human review and select the best response from multiple AI-generated options before it's sent to the user[cite: 327].

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### For Website Owners: Creating a Chatbot

The process for a website owner to create and deploy their own CIRA chatbot is straightforward:

![Flowchart for creating a CIRA chatbot](https://i.imgur.com/2sZ0w7F.png)
[cite_start]*Figure 1: Flow diagram on how website owners can create their own chatbot system from the CIRA Dashboard[cite: 250].*

1.  [cite_start]**Sign Up:** Create a new account on the CIRA dashboard[cite: 252].
2.  [cite_start]**Create Chatbot:** Enter the chatbot's name, the website URL for data fetching, and a starting message[cite: 253].
3.  [cite_start]**Customize:** Modify the chatbot's name, training data, and UI elements like font, color, and images[cite: 254].
4.  [cite_start]**Embed:** Copy the provided one-line code snippet and add it to your website[cite: 255].
5.  [cite_start]**Deploy:** The chatbot will now be live on your website[cite: 255].

### Behind the Scenes: The Chatbot's Logic

When a user interacts with the chatbot, CIRA performs the following steps to generate a response:

[cite_start]*Figure 2: CIRA's working flow diagram when a user asks a question[cite: 257].*

[cite_start]The data training process involves scraping internal links from the provided website, using AI to determine the most relevant pages based on the user's question, and then feeding the content of those pages to the LLaMA 2 model to generate an accurate answer[cite: 265, 267, 268, 269].

## üìà Results and Observations

[cite_start]We conducted a survey with students at Lovely Professional University to compare the efficiency of finding specific information using traditional methods versus using CIRA[cite: 216, 381].

### Time Taken to Find Information

* [cite_start]**Without CIRA:** A majority of participants (52%) took over 20 minutes to find the required information[cite: 383].
* [cite_start]**With CIRA:** An overwhelming 76% of participants found the information in under one minute[cite: 383].

![Survey results comparing time taken](https://i.imgur.com/3Yt4p6K.png)

### User Preference

[cite_start]All participants (100%) preferred using CIRA over traditional page hopping[cite: 384].

### Deployment Analysis

[cite_start]CIRA was deployed on the AeonFree hosting service website for 15 days to analyze user engagement[cite: 388, 390]. [cite_start]The results showed that over 85% of users were satisfied with the answers provided, and most queries were successfully resolved across various countries[cite: 393].
